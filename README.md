#Hello there. I'm proud to present this sudoku generator created from scratch by myself! ðŸ˜Ž
#It has attached three files generated by itself. Each file contains 10000 sudokus of different dimensions (9x9, 6x6 and 4x4).
#Depending on your computer the operations will take more or less time. In my case it generated all of the files in less than 2 minutes.
#Feel free to use it on your own. If you have any doubt about how it works just DM me on Twitter and we can talk about the code or whatever you are interested.
